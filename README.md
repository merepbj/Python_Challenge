# python_challenge I worked hard on this assignment and completed 2 one on one tutor sessions and 2 group sessions - I also am reading the python crash course book and am trying super hard

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  ```



## PyPoll


I analyzed a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). I calculated the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
